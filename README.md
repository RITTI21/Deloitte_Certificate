🏅 Deloitte Data Analytics Job Simulation – Certificate of Completion

I successfully completed the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program via Forage in June 2025. This simulation involved hands-on tasks in:

🔍 Data Analysis: Conducted practical data cleaning, transformation, and interpretation exercises.

🧩 Forensic Technology: Applied analytics techniques to identify potential fraud patterns and anomalies.

This experience enhanced my analytical thinking, Excel skills, and ability to derive insights from complex datasets — simulating real tasks performed by Deloitte professionals.
